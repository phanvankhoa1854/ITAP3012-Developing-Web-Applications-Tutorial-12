    Lesson 02: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
</h2>
<h2><b>History of HTML</b></h2>
<article>
    In 1993, Tim Berners-Lee developed the initial version of the hypertext markup language known as HTML. Since then, a large number of distinct iterations of HTML have been released. HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999, was the version that was used the most often during the whole decade of the 2000s. A rewriting of HTML using the XML markup language resulted in another version called XHTML.</article>
<h2><b>• HTML Syntax and Semantic
</b></h2>
<article>
    The arrangement of components and attributes to produce correctly formatted texts is referred to as syntax. Meaning is at the heart of what semantics has to offer. This is the function that elements and attributes serve in HTML, as well as the logical (sense and reference) connection that exists between elements and the attributes that are associated with those elements.</article>
<h2><b>HTML Tables</b></h2>
<article>
    Web developers are given the ability to organise data into rows and columns via the use of HTML tables.
    Web writers are given the ability to organise data such as text, photos, links, and even other tables into rows and columns of cells via the use of HTML tables. The table> element is used in the creation of HTML tables. Within this tag, the tr> tag is utilised in the creation of table rows, and the td> tag is utilised in the creation of data cells.</article>
<h2><b>HTML Forms
</b></h2>
<article>
    On a website, the usage of a webform, web form, or HTML form gives a user the ability to submit data that is then transmitted to a server to be processed. Due to the fact that online users fill out forms by utilising checkboxes, radio buttons, or text fields, forms may have the appearance of paper or database forms.

<h2><b>Web media</b></h2>
<article>
    Web media, often known as owned media, refers to channels that are under your control. It refers to the written material that you produce, like as e-books, white papers, presentations, and so on, for your website and blog. You have complete control over both the content and how it is distributed.
