    Lesson 03: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
</h2>
<h2><b>Introduction to CSS
</b></h2>
<article>
    The abbreviation CSS refers to the cascading style sheets. The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standard outlines how HTML components should look when rendered on screen, in print, or in any other medium. CSS is a time- and labor-saving technology. It is able to manage the layout of more than one web page at the same time. CSS files are where you'll save any external stylesheets you use.
    
    <h2><b>CSS Syntax
</b></h2>
<article>
    A selector, a property, and the value associated with that property make up the components of a CSS Syntax rule. The selector identifies the HTML element that will have its style specified by CSS and points to it. The CSS attribute is delimited by semicolons in each instance. It consists of the selector's name followed by the property and value pair that has been specified for that particular selection.
    
    <h2><b>â€¢ CSS Selectors
</b></h2>
<article>
    The initial component of a CSS Rule is called a CSS selector. It is a pattern of elements and other keywords that tells the browser which HTML elements should be picked to have the CSS property values included inside the rule applied to them. In other words, it is a directive.
    <h2><b>Box Model
</b></h2>
<article>
    When discussing the design and layout of a website using CSS, the phrase "box model" is used. The CSS box model is, in essence, a box that surrounds each and every element that is HTML-based. It is made up of the actual content, as well as margins, borders, and padding around it.</article>
