  Developing Web Applications

<h2><b>Introduction to Web Development</b></h2>
<article>
  Web development refers to the process of creating a website that may be accessed through the World Wide Web (WWW) or an internal network (intranet) (a private network). The construction of a website might include anything from the creation of a single static page consisting just of plain text to the development of complicated web apps, online companies, and social network services.

<h2><b>Internet definitions and history</b></h2>
<article>
  The word "Internet" was used in 1974 by Vint Cerf and his colleagues to refer to a single worldwide TCP/IP network that was outlined in the first comprehensive specification of TCP. When all of the hosts on the ARPANET were upgraded to use TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, the first TCP/IP wide area network came into existence. Previously, those hosts had been using earlier protocols.

<h2><b>Static Vs Dynamic Websites</b></h2>
<article>
  A website is considered to be static if its content does not change and visitors always see the same information regardless of the page they are on. On the other hand, a dynamic website is one that pulls material on the fly, which enables the website's content to alter depending on the person who is accessing it.

<h2><b>Client-Server Model</b></h2>
<article>

  The client-server paradigm is a framework for distributed applications that divides jobs or workloads between servers,
   who are the suppliers of a resource or service, and clients, which are the people that seek the servers' services.

<h2><b>What is Internet?</b></h2>
<article>
  The term "interconnection of computer networks" refers to what the Internet really is. 
  The Internet is really a vast network consisting of other networks. 
  It does this by linking millions of computers together around the globe to create a network 
  in which any computer may speak with any other computer as long as both computers are linked to the Internet.
